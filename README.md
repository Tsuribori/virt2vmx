# virt2vmx

Convert libvirt domain XML to VMX format. At current stage the project is meant to be a quick tool
for importing qemu-kvm VMs to VMWare infrastructure, not a comprehensive converting tool.

## Requirements

For VM disk conversion `qemu-img` command is required.

## Installation

Download from http://example.com/FIXME.

## Usage

    $ sudo java -jar virt2vmx-0.1.0-standalone.jar -f /path/to/VM.xml
    
This will write the VMX file and the VMDK to `pwd`. Note that `sudo` is usually required due to the
default permissions on libvirt domain XML files and `.qcow2` files. 

## Options

```
-f --file NAME Qemu file to convert
```

### Bugs

Probably plenty of bugs involving conversion, so please make a issue if you encounter one!
